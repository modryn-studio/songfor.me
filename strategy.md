# Monetization & Distribution Strategy

Validated March 2, 2026. This is the operating playbook for every tool shipped from Modryn Studio.

---

## Monetization — Ranked by Fit

### Tier 1: Email Capture (every tool, no exceptions)

Email is the meta-asset. Tools may live 1–3 months. The email list carries value across all of them.

Every tool must have a reason to give you an email: notify me when X, save results, weekly digest. This is not optional — it's the compounding mechanism across the entire product studio.

The shared Resend list is segmented per tool. One list, many segments, one broadcast when needed.

### Tier 2: One-Time Payment ($5–$29)

Best fit for trend-chased micro-tools. No subscription overhead, no auth, no user accounts. Stays local-first.

- $9 sweet spot — enough to filter freeloaders, low enough for impulse buy
- Pattern: free tier works → user hits a limit → PayGate → localStorage receipt
- Stripe handles the payment UI. Never build a custom checkout in a 48-hour window.

**Two paths, same PayGate component:**

|             | Payment Links (default)         | Checkout Sessions (upgrade)                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Code needed | Zero                            | API route + `stripe` npm                       |
| Env vars    | None                            | `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PRICE_ID`         |
| Setup       | Create link in Stripe Dashboard | Install SDK, configure route                   |
| Best for    | One price, one product          | Dynamic pricing, coupons, programmatic control |

Start with Payment Links. Upgrade to Checkout Sessions only when you need features Payment Links can't do.

**Stripe operational notes:**

- Disable Cash App Pay in Dashboard → Settings → Payment methods (90%+ of disputes come from it)
- Test mode: use test keys + card 4242 4242 4242 4242 during dev, switch to live keys at deploy
- Webhooks are NOT needed for localStorage receipt flow — add only when server-side verification is required (see issue #13)
- Merchant of Record (Paddle/Lemon Squeezy) is not needed at current scale — evaluate when international tax compliance becomes a burden (see issue #14)

Decision: set this in `context.md` before writing code. If the tool saves someone 30+ minutes of manual work, charge for it. If it's purely informational, email-only.

### Tier 3: Affiliate Links (week 2+ only)

Only when there's a natural product-adjacent next step the user already wants to take. Examples: hiking tool → AllTrails Pro, travel tool → booking.com, stock tool → broker referral.

Don't wire this during the 48-hour build. Evaluate after launch if the tool sticks and the product fit is obvious.

### Tier 4: Display Ads (50k+ monthly organic only)

Not worth the CLS penalty and code bloat below 50k monthly visitors. At 10k visits/month you're earning $50–150. Use mediation (not a single network) when you do add them.

Tracked in GitHub issue — evaluate when any single tool crosses 50k/month consistently.

## Distribution — Ranked by Impact

### 1. Reddit (primary channel)

Post in the subreddit where the pain lives, not the founder subreddit. Target subreddits should be identified during the discovery phase and stored in `context.md`.

Rules:

- Lead with the problem, not the product
- Post as a person who built something, not a marketer
- Engage comments for 24–48 hours — engagement = algorithm love
- Never buy upvotes. Bans are permanent.
- r/SideProject is the founder channel — useful but secondary

Store target subreddits in the tool JSON `subreddits` field so `/social` generates tailored copy per community.

### 2. Programmatic SEO (highest ceiling, slowest start)

Pattern: head term + modifiers (city, experience level, variant) = hundreds of unique pages.

Timeline reality check:

- Indexing: 4–8 weeks on a new subdirectory
- Meaningful traffic: 3–6 months
- This is the month-3+ compounding play, not day-1 revenue

Critical: each page needs genuine data differentiation. Swapping city names in a template will poison the domain. Use real API data per page.

Wire the page template during the 48-hour build if applicable. Don't count on organic traffic before month 3.

### 3. Building in Public on X

Post weekly — the build story, a milestone, a decision worth sharing:

- Document what you built, why, and what surprised you
- Always attach a screenshot or GIF of the tool in action

### 4. Indie Hackers (week 2)

Post-launch retrospective. The build story — what you spotted, what you built, and how fast — is as interesting as the tool itself.

### Skip: Product Hunt

Not worth the coordination overhead for trend-chased micro-tools. Your launch window is 48 hours; PH needs a week minimum.

## Per-Tool Launch Playbook

```
Day 0 (build):     Wire email capture + one monetization method
Day 1 (launch):    Reddit post in the pain subreddit(s)
                   X post with demo GIF
                   Submit to google search console
Day 2–3:           Engage Reddit comments aggressively
                   Start pSEO pages if applicable
Week 2:            Indie Hackers post — the build story
                   Evaluate affiliate fit
Month 1+:          pSEO compounds, email list grows
```

## Domain Strategy

All future trend-chased tools deploy under `modrynstudio.com` as subdirectory paths — not subdomains. Subdirectories inherit domain authority. Subdomains are treated as separate sites by Google.

- ✅ `modrynstudio.com/tools/hiking-finder` — inherits authority
- ❌ `hiking-finder.modrynstudio.com` — treated as a new domain, no authority inheritance

**Chosen approach: separate repo + Vercel rewrites**

Each tool is its own repo (from the boilerplate). It deploys to a free `.vercel.app` URL. `next.config.ts` in modryn-studio-v2 rewrites `modrynstudio.com/tools/[slug]/*` → the tool's Vercel URL. Google sees one domain and one authority footprint. The tool repo never needs a custom domain.

Setup per tool:

1. Tool repo: set `basePath: '/tools/[slug]'` in its `next.config.ts`
2. Tool repo: deploy to Vercel — note the `.vercel.app` deployment URL
3. modryn-studio-v2: add one rewrite entry in `next.config.ts` pointing that path to the deployment URL
4. modryn-studio-v2: add the tool JSON to `/content/tools/[slug].json` for the landing page

See GitHub issue #15 for the exact `next.config.ts` rewrite pattern and `basePath` setup.

**Other rules:**

- `/tools/[slug]` in modryn-studio-v2 is always the landing page (SEO magnet, email capture)
- One email list, one analytics dashboard, one SEO footprint
- SpecifyThat stays on `specifythat.com` — it predates the studio. Nothing new gets its own domain unless it earns a standalone brand later.
