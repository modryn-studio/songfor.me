# Copilot Setup — How To Use

---

## Phase 1: New Project Setup

Run these once when starting a new project.

1. Create a blank repo on GitHub, then clone it locally
2. Clone this boilerplate into the project folder:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/modryn-studio/nextjs_boilerplate .
   ```
3. Re-point the remote to the new project repo:
   ```powershell
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/modryn-studio/YOUR-REPO
   ```
4. Run `npm install`
5. **Fill `context.md` and `brand.md`** — two paths:
   - **Starting from scratch** → Open chat (`Ctrl+Alt+I`), select **Agent** mode, pick **@prebuilt**. Describe the idea. It researches, validates, and fills both docs when you say "fill it in."
   - **Docs already filled** → Drop your pre-filled `context.md` and `brand.md` into the project root, replacing the stubs. Skip to step 6.
6. Run `/validate` — web-searches competitors, user pain, SEO opportunity, and brand positioning. Review the report and iterate on docs if needed.
7. Type `/init` — reads all three source docs, fills in `copilot-instructions.md` + `src/config/site.ts`
8. Drop your logomark at `public/brand/logomark.png` and type `/assets` — generates all favicons, icons, and banner
9. Push to `main`

> After setup, **never edit `copilot-instructions.md` or `site.ts` directly**. Edit the source docs → run `/update`.

---

## Phase 2: While Building

This is the active development loop. No fixed order — use these as needed.

**Start the dev server**
`Ctrl+Shift+B` — starts the server and pipes output to `dev.log`. Tell Copilot **"check logs"** at any point to flag errors without pasting anything.

**Source docs changed?**
Edit `context.md` or `brand.md` → run `/update` immediately. Skipping this means Copilot works off stale context.

**Unsure if a package is current?**
Run `/deps` — validates all dependencies against live docs, surfaces breaking API changes.

**Register the tool on modrynstudio.com early**
Run `/tool` as soon as you have a homepage or hero built — even if the tool isn't functional yet. Use `status: "building"`. This puts it on the studio site immediately and starts building the URL footprint. Merge the PR as soon as it's up — don't hold it for launch.

**Write a build log entry**
Run `/log` any time something worth documenting ships — a working core feature, a key decision, a milestone. Don't save it for launch. Each post builds the public record and the SEO footprint while you're still building. Merge each PR as it's ready.

**Validate before a major phase**
Run `/validate` with a focus area (e.g. "validate the route map" or "validate the pricing") before building a major component. Catches misalignment early.

## Phase 3: Pre-Ship Checklist

Run these in order before going live. Each one builds on the last.

1. **`@check`** — quality gate. Scans for bugs, secrets, and code issues → auto-fixes what it can → runs lint + build → commits fixes. Never pushes.
2. **`/seo`** — auto-generates any missing SEO files, audits the codebase, walks through Search Console + Bing setup.
3. **`/launch`** — distribution checklist. Fixes sharing hooks, social footer, and share-on-X hooks. Always runs `/log` (launch post) and `/tool` (flip to `live`) — even if you ran them in Phase 2, these are the launch versions.

---

## Phase 4: Ship It

1. Merge the **launch** `/log` and `/tool` PRs that `/launch` just opened on modryn-studio-v2. (Phase 2 build PRs should already be merged.)
2. Switch to **modryn-studio-v2** in VS Code, then run:
   - `/deploy` — adds the rewrite to `next.config.ts` wiring `modrynstudio.com/tools/[slug]/*` → this tool's Vercel URL
   - `/social` — generates launch copy (X, Reddit, shipordie) using v2 voice rules

> `/deploy` and `/social` are modryn-studio-v2 commands. They only work when modryn-studio-v2 is open in VS Code.

> **modryn-studio-v2 only:** `/deploy` and `/social` exist only in that repo. Switch workspaces to run them.

### Brand Assets

Drop your logomark at `public/brand/logomark.png` (1024×1024, transparent background), then type `/assets`.

The script auto-detects whether your mark is colored or grayscale and generates the correct light/dark favicon pair.

**Optional overrides:**

- `public/brand/logomark-dark.png` — hand-crafted dark favicon (skips auto-inversion)
- `public/brand/banner.png` — 1280×320 README header (auto-generated if absent)

**What gets generated:**

| File                      | Purpose                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `public/icon-light.png`   | Favicon in light mode (via `layout.tsx` metadata) |
| `public/icon-dark.png`    | Favicon in dark mode (via `layout.tsx` metadata)  |
| `src/app/favicon.ico`     | Legacy fallback — Next.js file convention         |
| `src/app/icon.png`        | 1024×1024 — Next.js file convention               |
| `src/app/apple-icon.png`  | iOS home screen — Next.js file convention         |
| `public/brand/banner.png` | README header (auto-generated if absent)          |

OG image is generated at build time by `src/app/opengraph-image.tsx` — not a static file.

Or run directly (requires [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org)):

```powershell
.\scripts\generate-assets.ps1
```

### Hooks

**Format on Save** — files are auto-formatted with Prettier on save. Requires the [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) (VS Code will prompt). Rules in `.prettierrc`.

### MCP Servers

> **Tip:** To debug why a prompt or instruction isn't loading, open the Agent Debug panel: `Command Palette → Developer: Open Agent Debug Panel`. Shows system prompts, tool calls, and every customization loaded for the session. Replaces the old Diagnostics gear menu.

> **Tip:** After any session where you corrected Copilot on a boilerplate pattern, type `/create-instruction` to turn those corrections into a persistent `.instructions.md` file. Save it to `.github/instructions/` so it travels with the boilerplate. For multi-step procedures (e.g. a fix workflow), `/create-skill` packages it as a reusable runbook instead.
